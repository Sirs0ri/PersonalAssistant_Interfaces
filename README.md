# PersonalAssistant_Interfaces
Interfaces to communicate with my Personal Assistant (https://github.com/Sirs0ri/PersonalAssistant)

To be loaded via `../PersonalAssistant_Interfaces> python interface`

The interface is supposed to connect to Sam's server application and allow the user so send commands and receive results. If no server can be found, the host can be specified manually or it can be tried to start the server application on the host manually.
